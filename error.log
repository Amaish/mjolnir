The primary labour law in Kenya is the employment Act and it makes provision for probationary contracts. To terminate such a contract your employer should have issued you a 7 day notice or payment in lieu of notice i.e payment in place for failure of such notice. You are thus entitled to such sums for lack of notice and as per our constitution wages for work done. You can lodge your complaint with a labour officer within 3 months of such termination.

The Matrimonial Property Act which governs the rights and responsibilities of spouses in regard to matrimonial property makes provision for an agreement between the parties on separate property. You and your lover can draft an agreement that establishes the terms of ownership of assets, how to treat your future earnings and how to divide the property in the unfortunate event of a divorce. This agreement should be in writing and signed by both parties and it will take precedence over other principles of subdividing property.

The Matrimonial Property Act which governs the rights and responsibilities of spouses in relation to matrimonial property makes provision for an agreement between parties with regard to their property. This agreement allows parties to an intended marriage to establish the property/financial rights, to set out the terms of ownership of assets, how to treat future earnings and how to divide property. You and your lover can thus have this agreement drafted to protect your individual rights in the event of a divorce as it takes precedence to any principles of subdividing property.

You should visit the nearest police station with a copy of the Title or the Title Number, an Original National ID or Passport to obtain a police abstract confirming loss of the Title.\n\nYou should then swear an affidavit to confirm loss of Title. The Affidavit should state that the title shall be returned if found and should also state that that the Title has not been pledged as security for a loan.\n\nYou should then apply to the Lands registry for the issuance of a provisional Title in place of the lost Title. This is done by filling an application form.\n\nOnce the application is made, the Lands Registrar prepares a draft gazette notice which is taken to the Government Printers for publication of lost Title and is gazetted for 60 days. After the 60 days period expires, the Registrar issues a Provisional Certificate of Title as a replacement of the lost Title.

We are sorry for the threats you are receiving from your creditors. The applicable law in your situation is the Insolvency Act. The options you have are to either file for bankruptcy by engaging a lawyer to make the application for you. If this is not an option, you can make an application to the Official Reciver for a summary instalment order. This summary instalment order is an order made by the Official Reciver directing a debtor to pay their debts  in instalment or in a way the Receiver considers practical in that particular case. If you choose this option, the Official Receiver shall first give you and the creditors an opportunity to make your representations to him in regard to the debts you owe them then if he is satisfied he shall issue the order for you to pay in instalments. This order will prevent your things from being auctioned until you pay the debts.\nHave a good evening.
